# As a Full-Stack Developer

I upload one demo project in my public repository as a portfolio.

In this project I have frontend in ReactJS. I have designed the API here to send and receive data from the backend server. For the backend I use Laravel 9 (PHP 8). In the Laravel backend I configure the appropriate API mechanism to receive and send responses through the APIs. I have 5 years of experience in development. My main characteristic is my active cataloging, rational and analytical thinking which makes it easy to understand the real requirements of the work. As an engineer I easily look for competent, standardized and quality-oriented solutions. I am not a so called developer. I have a strong grasp on algorithms. If you have a complex problem and need a proper solution just schedule a qucik meeting on my email devarslan99@gmail.com
